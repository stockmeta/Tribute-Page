  <h3><center>Here's the timeline of Ramon Magsaysay:</center></h3>
  <div class="parent">
   <ul>
    <pre><li><strong>1907 </strong>Ramon del Fierro Magsaysay, of mixed Tagalog
and Ilocano descent, was born in Iba, Zambales on August 31, 1907</li></pre>
    <pre><li><strong>1927 </strong>He spent his grade school life somewhere in
Castillejos and his high school life at Zambales Academy in San Narciso,
Zambales. After college, Magsaysay entered the University of the Philippines in
1927, where he enrolled in a pre-medical course</li></pre>
    <pre><li><strong>1933 </strong>He was married to Luz Magsaysay (née Banzon) on
June 16, 1933 and they had three children: Teresita "Sita" (1934–1979),
Milagros "Mila" (1936) and Ramon "Jun" Banzon-Magsaysay, Jr. (1938).</li></pre>
    <pre><li><strong>1942 </strong>At the outbreak of World War II, he joined
the motor pool of the 31st Infantry Division of the Philippine Army. When Bataan
surrendered in 1942, Magsaysay escaped to the hills, narrowly evading Japanese
arrest on at least four occasions. There he organised the Western Luzon Guerrilla</li></pre>
    <pre><li><strong>1944 </strong>For three years, Magsaysay operated under Col.
Merrill's famed guerrilla outfit & saw action at Sawang, San Marcelino,
Zambales, first as a supply officer codenamed Chow and later as commander of a
10,000 strong force.[4] Magsaysay was among those instrumental in clearing the
Zambales coast of the Japanese prior to the landing of American forces together
with the Philippine Commonwealth troops on January 29, 1944.</li></pre>
    <pre><li><strong>1946 </strong>On April 22, 1946, Magsaysay, encouraged by
his ex-guerrillas, was elected under the Liberal Party to the Philippine
House of Representatives. In 1948, President Manuel Roxas chose Magsaysay to go
to Washington as Chairman of the Committee on Guerrilla Affairs, to help to
secure passage of the Rogers Veterans Bill, giving benefits to Philippine
veterans. In the so-called "dirty election" of 1949, he was re-elected to a
second term in the House of Representatives. During both terms he was Chairman
of the House National Defense Committee.</li></pre>
    <pre><li><strong>1950 </strong>In early August 1950, he offered President
Elpidio Quirino a plan to fight the Communist guerillas, using his own
experiences in guerrilla warfare during World War II. After some
hesitation, Quirino realized that there was no alternative and appointed
Magsaysay Secretary of National Defence on August 31, 1950. He intensified
the campaign against the Hukbalahap guerillas. This success was due in
part to the unconventional methods he took up from a former advertising
expert and CIA agent, Colonel Edward Lansdale.</li></pre>
    <pre><li><strong>1951 </strong>When news reached Magsaysay that his political
ally Moises Padilla was being tortured by men of provincial governor Rafael Lacson,
he rushed to Negros Occidental, but was too late. He was then informed that Padilla's
body was swimming in blood, pierced by fourteen bullets, and was positioned on a
police bench in the town plaza. Magsaysay himself arried Padilla's corpse with his
bare hands and delivered it to the morgue, and the next day, news clips showed
pictures of him doing so.</li></pre>
    <pre><li><strong>1953 </strong>In the election of 1953, Magsaysay was decisively
elected president over the incumbent Elpidio Quirino. He was sworn into office wearing
the Barong Tagalog, a first by a Philippine president. He was then called
"Mambo Magsaysay".</li></pre>
    <pre><li><strong>1957 </strong>Magsaysay's term, which was to end on December
30, 1957, was cut short by a plane crash. On March 16, 1957, Magsaysay left Manila
for Cebu City where he spoke at three educational institutions. That same night,
at about 1 am, he boarded the presidential plane "Mt. Pinatubo", a C-47, heading
back to Manila. In the early morning hours of March 17, the plane was reported
missing. By late afternoon, newspapers had reported the airplane had crashed on
Mt. Manunggal in Cebu, and that 36 of the 56 aboard were killed. The actual number
on board was 25, including Magsaysay. Only newspaperman Néstor Mata survived.
Vice-President Carlos García, who was on an official visit to Australia at the time,
assumed the presidency to serve out the last eight months of Magsaysay's term.

An estimated 2 million people attended Magsaysay's state funeral on March 22, 1957.
He was posthumously referred to as the "Champion of the Masses" and "Defender of
Democracy".</li></pre>
